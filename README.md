Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases my projects in Python, machine learning, and data analysis, including fraud detection models and exploratory analyses. Each project includes detailed documentation. Feel free to explore and reach out at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsangarides) for any questions or collaboration opportunities! 

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Python IDEs etc.

## Case Studies
**[`^        back to top        ^`](#data-science-portfolio)**

Welcome to the heart of my portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of diverse case studies that demonstrate my passion for data science and machine learning. These projects blend self-driven curiosity with targeted skill enhancement, showcasing my ability to address real-world challenges with innovative solutions. Each case study reflects my analytical prowess, coding skills, and commitment to continuous learning, from exploratory data analysis to advanced machine learning models. While the projects presented here highlight my technical capabilities and problem-solving approach, they represent just a fraction of my experience. I have also worked on numerous confidential and classified projects within the defence and medical sectors - not shown here. I invite potential employers and fellow enthusiasts to explore the following studies, which illustrate my journey in mastering the art of extracting valuable insights from complex datasets.


### Fraud Detection
A machine learning model developed to detect fraudulent transactions for a bank facing card fraudulent issues. The model prioritises high-risk transactions for review by a small team of analysts, aiming to maximise fraud prevention within the team's capacity of 500 reviews per month. Using a year's worth of historical transaction data and fraud flags, a predictive model is built to assess the likelihood of fraud for each transaction.
  - [Approach 1](https://github.com/): This model utilises an XGBoostClassifier algorithm
  - [Approach 2](https://github.com/): This model utilises an LSTM-RNN algorithm
  
### Customer Churn Prediction
